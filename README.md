# time-travel-clthom24

I am learning Git workflows, branching strategies, and collaborative development practices by creating a time-travel themed magazine. This repository demonstrates essential version control techniques including issue tracking, pull requests, and merge conflict resolution.

## Why these patterns are ignored
- target/: Maven build outputs that shouldn't be versioned
- *.class: Compiled Java class files
- .DS_Store: Mac system file that clutters repositories

## Branch Roles
- author/idea-sprint: used for drafting new ideas and creative writing.
- editor/review: used for reviewing and refining content before release.
